# gym_management_system
During my final year of the BSc in Computing, I led a four-member team to develop a web-based Gym Management System with features for membership, finance, and administration. As Project Leader, I managed timelines, coordinated the team, and contributed to development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
